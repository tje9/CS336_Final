Media Catalog
Vision Statement:
	Our web application is a media catalog that caters towards music, books, movies and even video games. Now days, people amass collections of media in different forms. Our media catalog aims to bring those collections together into one centralized place where the records can be entered, deleted, sorted and presented in different ways for the user to better visualize their collections.
	When the user first arrives at our website they will be prompted with a google sign in. After they have been authenticated they will come to the profile/home page that will allow them to see their different media collections listed. These will be the highest level categories of music, books, movies or video games. Upon selecting one of these categories it will display the entire collection that they will then be able to sort through.
	There will also be an entry page that allows the user to enter information into a form that will add a record to the specified catalog. This page will contain a main header, a message box and a form. There will also be links on each of the three pages to navigate to one of the other two so the user can get to any page at any time.
